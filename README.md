# Event Staking

## Introduction

This Project is part of JTG Hackathon 2023 and it aims to develop a smart contract that leverages the concept of staking to incentivize event attendance. The smart contract allows individuals to pay a small amount of cryptocurrency into a pool as a stake, RSVP for an event, and participate in sharing the pool reward only if they attend the event. If a participant fails to attend the event after requesting attendance, they forfeit their staked cryptocurrency.

## Technologies Used
